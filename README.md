# Ping-Pong-final
Independent Project
Author: Joshua Kariuki (J.M)
Project description: This is a web application that i have created. The app will operate with the numbers from 1 to 60, which the user will be able to input.The program will take the number that the users inputs, and will return a range of numbers (output). 
In addition, for all numbers that are divisible by 3, the app will output "Ping".                                                Example: (From 1 to 60) 1, 2, Ping, 4, 5, ping, 7, 8, ping, 10 etc...until 60. Notice the numbers 3, 6 and 9 are divisible by 3 and have been replaced.
All numbers divisible by 5, will be replaced with "Pong".                                                                        Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, Pong, 6, 7, 8, 9, pong. Notice the values 5, and 10 are replaced with pong because they are divisible by 5.
All numbers that are divisible by 15 will be replaced with "Ping Pong".                                                          Example: (From 1 to 60) the following values, 15, 30, 45 and 60 will be replaced with ping pong.
The app will also allow for this process to be repeated over and over again in a loop.
The app will ensure that old values (previous inputs) are scrapped off in order to output the correct data.
